## Project Description
Constructed for CPSC 408: Database management Assignment 3.  This program povides methods for a simple CRUD command line app in python.  

## Runtime Instructions
The user should start by constructing a SQLite database named `StudentDB.sqlite` and running the commands in the `databaseconstruction.txt` file to produce a "Students" table.  Then, one can run the `interface.py` file to bring up a command line interface for the program.

## Sources
Regex expressions for this program were developed using (Regex101)[https://regex101.com/] to check for validity.

In addition, the documentation for [Python Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) and [Pandas print options](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.option_context.html) were accessed to identify syntax.
